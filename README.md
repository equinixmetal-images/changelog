# Equinix Metal published images

Equinix Metal publishes images on the platform that have been built with the fleet's requirements in mind. These images are tested/validated against the fleet and are known to work with our metal. For most operating systems we publish fresh images on monthly basis, this guarantees a smooth user experience and reduces install times.

Images are kept as close to upstream releases as possible.

# Changelog

The changelog aims to show what packages have changed since the last published image, what kernel and what deviations from upstream (if any) per new published image.

If there is any information that would be helpful but is missing from the changelog, [please raise an issue](https://github.com/packethost/metal-images-changelog/issues/new) and we will do our best to add it going forward.
